# MVP Development Checklist

## General Setup
- [ ] Set up Python environment and project structure with FastAPI
- [ ] Configure Docker for local development and containerization
- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- [ ] Set up Redis for real-time features (e.g., pub/sub and caching)
- [ ] Create a centralized logging system for backend services

## Authentication
- [ ] Implement user registration and login endpoints
  - [ ] POST /auth/login
  - [ ] POST /auth/register (if needed)
- [ ] Set up JWT-based authentication
  - [ ] Short-lived access tokens
  - [ ] Refresh tokens for session continuation
- [ ] Add password hashing using a secure library (e.g., bcrypt)
- [ ] Integrate OAuth2 for Google/Microsoft SSO
- [ ] Write unit tests for all authentication endpoints and token generation

## Real-Time Messaging
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection handling with FastAPI
  - [ ] Create a WebSocket manager for connection tracking
  - [ ] Handle room subscriptions for channels
- [ ] Design and implement message broadcasting via Redis pub/sub
  - [ ] Publish messages to specific channels
  - [ ] Ensure delivered messages are stored persistently in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Add WebSocket message acknowledgment and error handling
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for message delivery and persistence

## Channel/DM Organization
- [ ] Create CRUD endpoints for channels
  - [ ] GET /channels
  - [ ] POST /channels (create new channel)
  - [ ] DELETE /channels/:id (delete a channel if authorized)
- [ ] Define database schema for Channels table
  - [ ] Fields: id, name, type, createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt
- [ ] Implement logic for channel membership
  - [ ] Track users who belong to a channel
- [ ] Add unit tests for channel-related API endpoints

## Database Schema and Queries
- [ ] Define Users table
  - [ ] Fields: id, email, passwordHash, status, lastActive
- [ ] Define Channels table
  - [ ] Fields: id, name, type, createdBy
- [ ] Define Messages table
  - [ ] Fields: id, channelId, userId, content, timestamp
- [ ] Optimize database queries
  - [ ] Add indices for channelId and userId in Messages table
- [ ] Write migration scripts using Alembic

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for individual API endpoints
- [ ] Create integration tests for user workflows
  - [ ] Test: login → join channel → send message
- [ ] Set up performance tests for WebSocket connections and database queries
- [ ] Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

## Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints with OpenAPI schema
- [ ] Provide examples for each endpoint
  - [ ] cURL examples
  - [ ] Postman snippets
- [ ] Write README with setup instructions and developer guidelines

## DevOps and Deployment
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml file
  - [ ] Configure PostgreSQL service
  - [ ] Configure Redis service
  - [ ] Configure FastAPI backend
- [ ] Set up environment configurations
  - [ ] Local development
  - [ ] Production
- [ ] Ensure Kubernetes compatibility for deployment
